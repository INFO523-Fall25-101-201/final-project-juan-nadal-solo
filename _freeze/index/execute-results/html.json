This project investigates: **Are movie stars worth their premium salaries?**\n\nUsing data mining techniques, I analyzed whether star power—measured as cast members' historical ROI—predicts financial success better than factors like budget discipline, release timing, and franchise status.\n\n### Dataset\n\nThe analysis uses three merged Kaggle datasets: 5\\,311 movies spanning 1915-2017, representing $485.6 billion in revenue and $167.2 billion in budgets.\n\n**Key Variables:**\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `roi` | Target: (Revenue - Budget) / Budget * 100 |\n| `cast_avg_roi` | Average historical ROI of cast members |\n| `budget_micro` | Binary flag for micro-budget films |\n| `vote_average` | Audience rating (0-10) |\n| `is_franchise` | Whether part of a franchise |\n| `star_tier` | Superstar, A-list, B-list, or Unknown |\n\n**Limitation:** Only 640 movies (12%) have complete cast ROI data.\n\n## Methodology\n\nI used a two-pronged approach: traditional statistics (correlation, ANOVA, t-test) and machine learning (6 regression models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Lasso).\n\n**Why this approach?** Correlation measures linear relationships. ANOVA compares means across star tiers. The t-test directly compares premium talent vs. others. Machine learning captures non-linear patterns and ranks feature importance.\n\nSix models were compared to ensure robust findings—if multiple algorithms agree that star power ranks low, the conclusion is reliable.\n\n## Results\n\n### Statistical Evidence\n\n**Correlation:** Star power has a weak correlation with ROI (r = 0\\.078), explaining only 0\\.6% of variance.\n\n::: {#cell-correlation-heatmap .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\ncorr_matrix = df[['roi', 'cast_avg_roi', 'budget', 'vote_average', 'vote_count']].corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.3f', cmap='RdBu_r', center=0, square=True, ax=ax)\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix: ROI and Key Predictors', fontweight='bold')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Correlation Matrix](index_files/figure-html/correlation-heatmap-output-1.png){#correlation-heatmap width=632 height=565}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**T-Test:** Top-tier stars (A-list + Superstar) show +121% higher average ROI than others. However, Cohen's d = 0\\.14 indicates negligible effect size—the distributions overlap heavily, meaning stars don't guarantee returns.\n\n::: {#cell-star-tier-boxplot .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\ntier_order = ['Superstar', 'A-list', 'B-list', 'Unknown/C-list']\nsns.boxplot(data=df[df['star_tier'].isin(tier_order)], x='star_tier', y='roi', order=tier_order, ax=ax)\nax.set_ylim(0, df['roi'].quantile(0.95))\nax.set_xlabel('Star Tier')\nax.set_ylabel('ROI (%)')\nax.set_title('ROI Distribution by Star Tier', fontweight='bold')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![ROI by Star Tier](index_files/figure-html/star-tier-boxplot-output-1.png){#star-tier-boxplot width=758 height=469}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Machine Learning Evidence\n\n**Critical Correction:** Initial models showed 93.2% R-squared with star power dominating. I discovered target leakage—revenue was included as a predictor. Since ROI = (Revenue - Budget) / Budget, this was circular logic.\n\nAfter removing revenue, XGBoost achieved 33\\.7% R-squared. The corrected feature importance:\n\n::: {#cell-feature-importance .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\ntop_features = feature_importance.head(15).iloc[::-1]\ncolors = ['#e74c3c' if 'cast_avg_roi' in f else '#3498db' for f in top_features['Feature']]\nax.barh(top_features['Feature'], top_features['Importance'] * 100, color=colors)\nax.set_xlabel('Importance (%)')\nax.set_title('Feature Importance (XGBoost, Revenue Excluded)', fontweight='bold')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Feature Importance (Top 15)](index_files/figure-html/feature-importance-output-1.png){#feature-importance width=949 height=565}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Finding:** Budget category ranks #1 at 30\\.4% importance. Star power (`cast_avg_roi`) ranks #np.int64(23) at 1\\.12%. Budget is **27x more important** than star power.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBoth statistical and machine learning evidence converge: **movie stars are not worth their premiums based on ROI.**\n\nThe weak correlation (r = 0\\.078) and low feature importance (1\\.1%) show star power has minimal predictive value. While stars show higher average ROI, the negligible effect size (d = 0\\.14) reveals this is driven by outliers, not consistent performance.\n\nBudget discipline ranking first aligns with industry reality: micro-budget films need smaller returns to profit. A $2M film earning $10M achieves 400% ROI, while a $200M blockbuster earning $400M achieves only 100%.\n\n**Limitations:** The 34% R-squared means 66% of variance is unexplained—likely marketing, word-of-mouth, and cultural timing. Data ends in 2017, before streaming transformed the industry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross 5\\,311 films, star power ranks #np.int64(23) of 51 features at 1\\.1% importance. Budget discipline is 27x more important.\n\n**Recommendation:** Studios should prioritize budget management, franchise development, and audience engagement over celebrity salaries. Unknown actors may offer better risk-adjusted returns than expensive A-list talent.\n\n",
